            <h2> Consequences of sleep deprivation:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Deterioration of cognitive functions (memory, attention, thinking), coordination, speech, orientation, control and others. Often it leads to accidents at work and on the road. According to statistics, one in five accidents occurs because the driver fell asleep at the wheel.</li>
                
                <li> Immunity Vulnerability. Studies show that lack of sleep increases the risk of getting sick by a factor of three. During sleep, the immune system synthesizes cytokine proteins. The more infections around, the more it takes. But if a person doesn't get enough sleep, cytokines simply don't have time to be produced. It's not for nothing that they say sleep heals.</li>
                
                <li>Overeating and being overweight. Lack of sleep stimulates the production of ghrelin, the hormone of hunger. As a consequence, the person overeats. The tired brain demands more and tastier food.
                Reduced productivity. When a person wants to sleep, he does everything slowly and poorly. What usually takes an hour can take two or three or more. And there's no guarantee that you won't have to redo it. The efficiency of time stolen from sleep tends toward zero.</li>
                
                <li>Falling motivation. Constant lack of sleep destroys motivation like groundwater erodes foundations. Every day there is less and less desire to move forward toward your goals.</li>
                
                <li>Bad habits and bad moods. Lack of sleep is a serious obstacle to the formation of healthy habits. But it is a great catalyst for bad ones: when a person doesn't get enough sleep, he looks for external stimulants (nicotine, caffeine and so on). If a person doesn't get enough sleep, he is irritable and offended with the world.</li>
                
                <li>Bad appearance. Lack of sleep is literally imprinted on the face in the form of bruises and bags under the eyes. Prolonged lack of sleep provokes premature skin aging.</li>

            <h2>How to Improve Sleep?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>give up coffee in the afternoon.</b> Caffeine stays in your body for eight to ten hours. Find alternatives to coffee drinks: drink water, green tea and natural juices to boost energy levels and focus on daily tasks;</li>
                
                <li><b>minimize your alcohol consumption.</b> Do not consume alcoholic beverages for three hours before going to bed. Alcohol, although it makes you sleepy, is also detrimental to a comfortable, sound sleep because it affects the brain and other organs. Alcohol intoxication is characterized by palpitations, increased activity of all vital processes, nausea, vomiting, and frequent calls to the toilet. All of these symptoms can prevent a person from sleeping;</li>
                
                <li><b>one hour before going to sleep, avoid light sources.</b> Even minimal amounts of "blue" light from smartphones, laptops, alarm clocks, televisions and other appliances can disrupt the production of melatonin, which regulates sleep and wakefulness cycles. Taking melatonin supplements or over-the-counter sleeping pills can lead to insomnia, especially if taken in high doses. "Sleepy" pills can cause a hangover-like feeling in the morning;</li>
                
                <li><b>no loud noises.</b> Soothing, quiet sounds can help you fall asleep. Noise from the sea or rain, pleasant classical music, or meditation music;</li>
                
                <li><b>eating the right foods before bedtime.</b> Eating heavy meals late in the day directly interferes with our body's ability to relax.</li>
